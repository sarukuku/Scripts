## Welcome!
This is a repo where I keep all kinds of commandline tools & scripts I've built to myself that might even slightly be of use to anyone else. All comments & improvements are welcome!

### osx_basic_maintenance.sh
- Checks for all available updates & installs them
- Cleans log files
- Empties the trash
- Runs all the built in maintenance scripts
- Checks & tries to repair the startup volume
- Repairs disk permissions

### svg2png.sh
- Converts all .svg ending files in the current directory to .png files
- Doesn't delete the .svg files
- The width is hardcoded in the script (-w 600) but it can be easily changed

### create_wp_project.sh
- Creates a WP development environment project structure
- Pulls in a theme boilerplate
- Pulls in newest WP version for install
- Links the theme to a defined git repository
